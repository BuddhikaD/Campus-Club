# NSBM - NSBM Green University

We as women, we gather students and motivate them with the concept FOSS. Let them feel the freedom with the interpersonal skills and leadership building is our main priority. 

We lend a hand to support all the females out there, to help them overcome their struggles when working in the tech industry.
