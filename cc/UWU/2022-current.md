# UWU - Uva Wellassa University

Mozilla Campus Club - UWU is a community organization which supports university students to contribute Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects to make global web better.
The worldâ€™s communications infrastructure needs to contend with pervasive surveillance, censorship, and misinformation. The need for us, as foundations, to join in advancing the university students in this rapidly evolving digital environment is greater than ever.
The declaration We are seeking like a Mozilla Campus club-UWU to make the internet an open, secure, and fair space protecting free expression and privacy, and advancing economic opportunity, knowledge exchange, and civic engagement that everyone can access and afford.
We look forward to working with established partners and new ones with a common ambition to curtail the use of digital technologies as tools for repression and manipulation, and to strengthen their use in building more just, accessible, and open societies.
