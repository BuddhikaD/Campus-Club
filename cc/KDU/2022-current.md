Our club hosts regular workshops, hackathons, and speaker sessions with industry professionals to help students improve their technical skills and contribute to open source projects. Our FOSS community believe that open source software can change the world and make it a better place, and Our FOSS community invite anyone in side KDU who shares this vision to join us and become a part of our community.
