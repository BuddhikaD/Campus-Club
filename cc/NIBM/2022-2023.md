The NIBM FOSS Community was founded by a group of NIBM students and volunteers who believe in the importance of spreading free and open-source knowledge on the NIBM campus, and it is maintained by the NIBM Computing Society by providing a platform for members who are passionate about using and contributing to open-source technologies to learn, collaborate, and share their knowledge and experiences under the guidance of the core team. Community members are highly skilled and enthusiastic people who have joined together to form a community of free and open-source development, and to inspire aspiring developers to connect with the open-source community and embrace their passion for technology, while the community aims to foster a culture of innovation, collaboration, and inclusivity and to promote the use of open-source technologies within the institute and beyond. By becoming members of this community, they can gain valuable skills, build their professional networks, and make meaningful contributions to the open-source community. This allows them to work together as a team and always collaborate to build open-source technology on the NIBM campus and connect with the global tech network.
